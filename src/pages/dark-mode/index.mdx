## Why add a dark mode toggle?

Having a dark mode toggle is really important nowadays. It's pleasing to the eye and almost a necessity in dark environments. So, I made
it one of the first features to be implemented in this website.

Though adding it was pretty straightforward (thanks to CSS variables!), it took quite some time as I had to edit and add a lot of styles in
CSS. If you're considering adding a dark mode to your website, I'd suggest you to do it early on. That way there should be less sytles
to change.

## Implementation (Get ready for a lot of CSS üòÅ)

First of all, l globally declared all my light mode colors in CSS,

```css
:root {
  --clr-primary: #ffffff;
  --clr-secondary: #f7fafc;
  --clr-border: #dde0e2;
  --text-primary: #000000;
  --text-secondary: #4a5568;
  --header-bg-color: #663399;
}
```

and my dark mode colors in a class `dark-mode`.

```css
.dark-mode {
  --clr-primary: #333333;
  --clr-secondary: #212121;
  --clr-border: #000000;
  --text-primary: #ffffff;
  --text-secondary: #e2e8f0;
  --header-bg-color: #333333;
}
```

Then, I configured my CSS styles to use these variables. For example:

```css
.site-header {
  grid-area: header;
  justify-self: stretch;
  align-self: stretch;
  background: var(--header-bg-color); // 1
  border-color: var(--clr-border); // 2
}
.card-class {
  background-color: var(--clr-primary); // 3
  border-color: var(--clr-border); // 4
}
```

What's going to happen is that when a class of `dark-mode` is set to any element, the dark-mode colors override the default colors
(only for elements inside it!). When the class is removed, the default colors get back in place.

You can try it out yourself by opening dev tools and adding (or removing) the class `dark-mode` to an element (`html` or `body` for full
effect!).

Next, I hooked up a button (in the header) with a JS function to toggle the class `dark-mode` on the body element when clicked.
To remember the state of the theme (light or dark), I stored a key value pair in local storage.

```javascript
export function toggleDarkMode() {
  const body = document.body;
  if (body.classList.toggle("dark-mode")) {
    localStorage.setItem("dark-mode", true);
  } else {
    localStorage.setItem("dark-mode", false);
  }
}
```

The button toggles the theme, everything displays fine in both the modes and user-preference is remembered in local storage.
However, I haven't given any code which checks local storage on page load and sets the theme to the user's preference.

I did just that initially, but ran into a problem.

### The Problem

If the user's preference was set to dark mode, then on page reload (or on a later visit), the light theme would show for a fraction of a
second before turning dark. Basically equivalent to a white flash. Though a minor issue, it was quite annoying. While searching online
for a fix, I stumbled upon an awesome Gatsby plugin called
[`gatsby-plugin-use-dark-mode`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-use-dark-mode/).

## Gatsby Plugin Use Dark Mode

This plugin prevents the flash of the default theme. You can find out how it works over
[here](https://github.com/donavon/use-dark-mode#that-flash). To top it off, it also queries the
[`prefers-color-scheme`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) media query on page load
and applies the user's preferred theme automatically!

A really nifty plugin to have! Especially after spending long hours setting up a dark mode toggle.

You can find the full source code for this dark mode implementation at this project's
[github repository](https://github.com/InfernoCoder11/personal-blog).
