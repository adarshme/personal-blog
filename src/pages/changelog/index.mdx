So I've decided to make a changelog blog post everytime I make a few changes on this site. This is the first changelog post. Let's get
right to it!

## Sticky Header

The header slides up and gets hidden when you scroll down a little. It slides back down as soon as you scroll up. Now you don't have
to scroll all the way to the top to access the header.

## Tags

I've added tags to all the blog posts. You can now go to <Link to="/tags">all tags</Link> and view blog posts by tag.

## Custom 404 Page

Earlier the 404 page would display nothing. Now it's much better. Check it out <Link to="/404">here</Link>

## Improved navigation

I've added links to previous and next blog posts, home and all tags at the end of each blog post. In case you didn't know, you can click
on "Inferno's Blog" in the header to go home too. There's some more navigation links here and there in the site.
