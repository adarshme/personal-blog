## Introduction
Hey there, welcome to my first ever blog post!

My name is Adarsh Menon. I live in India, in the Delhi NCR region. I'm a grade 12<sup>th</sup> student who loves to code 😀.
Almost all ***tech*** related stuff interests me. Python was the first language I started to learn, about four years back. Since then I've had
an insatiable hunger to learn more and more.

I learnt some Basic C++ (pun intended) in school. After a few months making a lot of small hobby projects, I decided to learn JavaScript.
It is a truly vast language, used almost everywhere, from frontend and backend technologies, mobile and desktop apps, to heck even
on [drones](https://wesbos.com/drone-javascript/).

## How I built this blog site
As you might have seen in the cover image, I'm using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
to make this website. 

Gatsby is an open source JavaScript framework based on [React](https://reactjs.org/), used to build blazing fast static websites. React is a
component based JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, and Tailwind is a CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
They all deserve their own blog posts so I will be writing more about them.

In case you're wondering, the font used in this website is the [inter font](https://rsms.me/inter/).

### Learning resources
I'd like to link all the awesome courses I did which helped me **a lot** in making this website. A huge thanks to
[WesBos](https://wesbos.com) for making these courses.

- [React for beginners](https://reactforbeginners.com/)
- [CSS Grid](https://cssgrid.io/)
- [What The FlexBox](https://flexbox.io/)

Checkout [LevelUpTuts's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2H7fWhQcdE&list=PLLnpHn493BHHfoINKLELxDch3uJlSapxg) video
tutorials for making a blog using GatsbyJS.

## Plans for the website
I'll be writing about cool tech related stuff and maybe some off-topic, but mostly tech.

You can expect this blog site to change a lot over time. Currently it's just a barebones website lacking several features like a dark mode
toggle, an upvote system, a comments section, and so on. It also requires an about and contact page. If you have any other feature 
requests or suggestions feel free to open an issue in this project's [github repository](https://github.com/InfernoCoder11/blog).
